Want the following things:

* Repositories for nuget and docker. There should be one for mirroring and one for local things
  * Also needs a blob storage for each. Each blob should be placed in it's own path on drive dedicated to that storage type
    (i.e. all nuget blobs end up in one drive, all docker blobs end up in one drive etc.)
* LDAP authentication
* Give specific groups access
